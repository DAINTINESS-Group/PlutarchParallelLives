Deadline first version of GUI --> 10-15/12/2020

PROBLEMS:
    1) The opencart data are too big for my app. I need to change the tableview prefsize to be able to show them,
    and there is still the problem that dont fit in the screen
    2) There are corrupted files in schemaEvo dataset. (lifedetails in tablestats sometimes doesnt map correct to transitions)




TODO: (future/optional/need more discussion)
    - Update the use cases in the diploma text.
    - Keep record of the Table Attributes "Birth Attributes + UPDATES"
