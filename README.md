# Plutarch Parallel Lives

This is a project for the monitoring of the evolution of the parallel histories of entities that evolve in parallel.
This is a new, that builds upon the previous Plutarch_Parallel_Lives (attn to the underscores at the name) that visualized the schema evolution of the tables of a relational schema.
